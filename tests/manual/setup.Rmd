Test script to manually validate creating a new rdev package or R analysis package.

# Setup

Load devtools. Load package manually using `devtools::load_all(".")` (command-shift-l).

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# devtools already loaded
htmltools::tagList(
  xaringanExtra::use_clipboard(
    button_text = "<i class=\"fa fa-clipboard fa-2xl\"></i>",
    success_text = "<i class=\"fa fa-check fa-2xl\" style=\"color: #90BE6D\"></i>"
  ),
  rmarkdown::html_dependency_font_awesome()
)
```

# Create GitHub Repository

**Given:**

- rdev and dependencies are installed in the R site library (using `setup-r`)
- Running in a session with no project open

**When:**

Creating a new GitHub repository with the following command:

```r
rdev::create_github_repo("rdtest1", "rdev test package 1")
```

**Then:**

- [ ] A new rdev package named "rdtest1" is created in the active GitHub account, downloaded to the
      local system, and populated with package files using usethis options in `~/.Rprofile`
- [ ] On macOS, the repository is opened in GitHub Desktop
- [ ] On macOS, the repository settings are opened on github.com
- [ ] Branch protection applied to the default branch:
  - [ ] Require a pull request before merging
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
  - [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - [ ] Status checks that are required:
    - [ ] lint, GitHub Actions
    - [ ] macos-latest (release), GitHub Actions
    - [ ] missing-deps, GitHub Actions
    - [ ] windows-latest (release), GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Require linear history
- [ ] Code security and analysis:
  - [ ] Dependabot alerts
  - [ ] Dependabot security updates
- [ ] The git repository will contain a single commit, 'Initial commit', with:
  - [ ] `LICENSE`: GitHub MIT License, with active GitHub user's name and current year in Copyright
  - [ ] `.gitignore`: GitHub
        [R.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/R.gitignore)
- [ ] There will be 4 new files:
  - [ ] `.Rbuildignore`
  - [ ] `DESCRIPTION`
  - [ ] `NAMESPACE`
  - [ ] `rdtest1.Rproj`

## Regression

Regression tests:

- [ ] Confirm that running `rdev::create_github_repo("rdtest1")` errors when the "rdtest1" directory
      exists in `usethis:::conspicuous_place()`

```r
rdev::create_github_repo("rdtest1")
```

# Initialize rdev package

**Given:**

- Running in an interactive session at the rdtest1 project root
- Commands in 'Create GitHub Repository' have been run

**When:**

Following `?quickstart`, without committing to git, initialize the rdev package by running `init()`
in the newly created project:

```r
rdev::init()
```

When prompted, select "Yes" and "implicit mode":

```
Initialize rdev package (run after create_github_repo)? (yes/No/cancel) y

...

This project contains a DESCRIPTION file.
Which files should renv use for dependency discovery in this project? 

1: Use only the DESCRIPTION file. (explicit mode)
2: Use all files in this project. (implicit mode)

Selection: 2
```

**Then:**

- [ ] The 4 new files (`.Rbuildignore`, `DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, `rdtest1.Rproj`) will be
      committed to GitHub with the message `rdev::create_github_repo()`

There will be 22 new or changed files (new unless otherwise noted):

- [ ] `.github/.gitignore`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/lint.yaml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/missing-deps.yaml`
- [ ] `.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml`
- [ ] `.gitignore`: changed, add 'macOS, vim' section
- [ ] `.lintr`
- [ ] `.Rbuildignore`: changed, sorted
- [ ] `.Rprofile`
- [ ] `DESCRIPTION`: changed
  - [ ] License: MIT
  - [ ] Suggests: desc, devtools, fs, knitr, pkgload, rdev (>= 1.9.1), rmarkdown,
        testthat (>= 3.0.0), usethis
  - [ ] URL: GitHub pages, GitHub repo
  - [ ] BugReports: GitHub issues
  - [ ] Remotes: jabenninghoff/rdev
  - [ ] Config/testthat/edition: 3
- [ ] `LICENSE.md`
- [ ] `man/rdtest1-package.Rd`
- [ ] `NEWS.md`
- [ ] `R/package.R`
- [ ] `README.md`
- [ ] `README.Rmd`
- [ ] `renv.lock`
- [ ] `renv/.gitignore`
- [ ] `renv/activate.R`
- [ ] `renv/settings.json`
- [ ] `tests/testthat.R`
- [ ] `tests/testthat/test-package.R`
- [ ] `TODO.md`

On GitHub:

- [ ] GitHub Pages, enabled:
  - [ ] Branch: default, folder: /docs
- [ ] Website (homepage) set to GitHub Pages URL

**Task:**

Following `?quickstart`, manually update the Title and Description fields in the DESCRIPTION file
(without committing):

```r
desc::desc_set(Title = "Rdev Test Package 1")
desc::desc_set(Description = "Used in manual testing of the rdev package.")
```

## Regression

Regression tests:

- [ ] Confirm that `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is owner-executable (must be executable to work) and
      matches the `pre-commit` template:

```sh
dir .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

```
-rwxr--r--  1 agamemnon  staff  409 Jan 30 15:58 .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

```sh
cat .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

```
#!/bin/bash
# forked from https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/blob/main/inst/templates/readme-rmd-pre-commit.sh
README=($(git diff --cached --name-only | grep -Ei '^README\.[R]?md$'))
MSG="use 'git commit --no-verify' to override this check"

if [[ ${#README[@]} == 0 ]]; then
  exit 0
fi

if [[ README.Rmd -nt README.md ]]; then
  echo -e "README.md is out of date; please re-knit README.Rmd\n$MSG"
  exit 1
fi
```

# Setup rdev

**Given:**

- Running in an interactive session at the rdtest1 project root
- Commands in 'Create GitHub Repository' have been run
- Commands in 'Initialize rdev package' have been run

**When:**

Following `?quickstart`, without committing to git, running `setup_rdev()` to configure the package
as an rdev package:

```r
rdev::setup_rdev()
```

When prompted, answer "Yes" to all questions:

```

1: Yes
2: No

Selection: 1
...
Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]: y
...
Do you want to proceed? [Y/n]: y
```

Additionally, `ci()` will run successfully, generating the following `R CMD check` note:

```
> checking package subdirectories ... NOTE

## Regression

Regression tests:

## Build Quarto Site

Test the installation by the Quarto builder, which should throw an error:

```r
build_quarto_site()

#> Error in build_analysis_site() : No *.Rmd files in analysis directory
```

Create an analysis notebook in RStudio using File > New File > R Markdown... > From Template >
Analysis Notebook, save in `analysis` as `test.Rmd`, removing all `library` commands in the setup
block except `library(dplyr)`, remove `order:` in the header, and re-run the checks, which should
complete successfully:

```r
build_quarto_site()
```
