## Overview

rdev supports my personal workflow, including creation of both traditional R packages and R Analysis
Packages (`vignette("analysis-package-layout")`), enforcing consistency across packages, and
providing Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automation. I use the tools in rdev to
improve code quality, speed up development of R code, and publish results of analyses in R Notebooks
as HTML to make them accessible to non-R users.

## Installation

My current R development environment uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig/), [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), [GitHub](https://github.com), a collection of R packages including rdev, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and [Vim](https://www.vim.org).

### Homebrew

I use [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) to install all software on my systems; my basic macOS working environment is published on GitHub in [macos-env](https://github.com/jabenninghoff/macos-env/tree/master).

### Installing R

rig supports installation of multiple versions of official R binaries, which I use for
reproducibility. To install R using rig, first install rig:

```sh
brew tap r-lib/rig
brew install --cask rig
```

Then install desired versions of R. The following installs R 3.4 through 4.3 on Intel based macs
(as of 2023-11-13):

```sh
rig install oldrel/6 --without-pak
rig install oldrel/5 --without-pak
rig install oldrel/4 --without-pak
rig install oldrel/3 --without-pak
rig install oldrel/2 --without-pak
rig install oldrel/1 --without-pak
rig install oldrel --without-pak
rig install release --without-pak
rig default release
```

I don't use [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org), which rig installs by default, as it is not yet fully
[supported](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/1210) by renv.

### Development Tools

Well, obviously, I use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). RStudio is the leading
IDE for R development and integrates with many R packages, although it sometimes falls short; I use
GitHub and the command line for Git, and occasionally Visual Studio Code (which has better support
for markdown) and Vim (which is faster for some types of edits).

RStudio, the GitHub desktop client, and Visual Studio Code are easily installed using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask rstudio
brew install --cask github
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

It is recommended to change the default settings for `.RData` in RStudio (in Options > General >
Basic > Workspace):

- Uncheck "Restore .Data into workspace at startup"
- Set "Save workspace to .Data on exit" to "Never"

Vim is installed by default on macOS and most Unix-like systems. 

### Packages

Managing packages and environments are a challenge for most modern languages. Thankfully R doesn't
have the same level of challenge as python, or even ruby, managing packages available within a
project is a best practice. I use [renv](https://github.com/rstudio/renv) for this purpose, and use
renv to install and manage all packages in all of my projects.

The `setup-r` script from rdev installs a base set of packages needed to run rdev in the R User
Library. A streamlined version of that script is included below.

```sh
# fix rig permissions
sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/*/Resources/library

RVERSION=`Rscript -e 'cat(as.character(getRversion()[1,1:2]))'`
USERLIB="$HOME/Library/R/`uname -m`/${RVERSION}/library"
DEVPKG='c("renv", "styler", "lintr", "miniUI", "markdown", "rmarkdown", "devtools", "pkgdown", "available")'
GITPKG='c("jabenninghoff/rdev")'

if [ ! -d "${USERLIB}" ]
then
	mkdir -p "${USERLIB}"
fi

echo "install.packages(${DEVPKG}, repos=\"https://cloud.r-project.org\", lib=\"${USERLIB}\")" | R --no-save
echo "remotes::install_github(${GITPKG}, lib=\"${USERLIB}\")" | R --no-save
```

The `chown` command is needed to allow updating the base packages using the RStudio Packages
"Update" function. I generally update packages in RStudio with no projects open before starting
development, then update packages in projects using `renv::update()`.

If you're installing (development) versions of packages from GitHub, it is recommended to set up a
personal access token using `usethis::create_github_token()` and adding it to your `.Renviron` as
`GITHUB_PAT=` using `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

### Further Reading

My workflow has been heavily influenced by the DevOps movement and the research of the
[DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) team at
Google started by Dr. Nicole Forsgren. Their [research](https://dora.dev/research/) shows how
technical and non-technical [capabilities](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/) improve outcomes.

The functions included in rdev support many of the technical capabilities, including:

- Code maintainability
- Continuous delivery
- Continuous integration
- Deployment automation
- Shifting left on security
- Test automation
- Trunk-based development
- Version control
